            <h2>How the Dashboard Represents the Welding Processes</h2>
            <p>This data dashboard is meant to help operators monitor friction stir welding machinery.</p>
            <p>Friction stir welding is an industrial process used to weld metal by spinning a large pin into 
            the metal surface and generating a lot of friction such that the metals approach melting point 
            and get mixed together. The process is uses extremely large forces that generate a lot of heat 
            and an important aspect to getting good weld quality includes maintaining the temperature and 
            surface finish of the welded metal. The sensors monitored here are indicators of a functioning 
            process.</p>
            <p>Thermocouple temperature monitoring works by embedding 8 thermocouples into the anvil below the 
            weld surface. As the machine moves over the part being welded near the thermocouples, the 
            temperature increases. Knowing the rate of motion and the temperature gradient observed in the 
            plot, we can calculate the max temperature of the weld to ensure it does not get too hot or too 
            cold. We can also calculate the total energy input into the weld system.</p>

            <p>Camera frames can be used to observe the amount of flash generated at the weld surface. Flash is 
            defined as hot metal that is extruded out of the surface if the metal gets too hot. If it is 
            observed, the process should be cooled in-situ.</p>

            <p>Accelerometer data can be used to observe the acceleration of the machine in the x, y, and z 
            axis. The acceleration data usually shows features of high torque when the machine is running too 
            cold. Similarly, low torque and acceleration can indicate the process is too high. Additionally, 
            acceleration can be used in calculating total energy imparted into the system. Additionally, 
            certain patterns in acceleration combination data can be correlated to certain defects in the 
            welds.</p>
            <p>Acoustic data is gathered at 394000 Hz. The data is then plotted in the frequency domain or as a 
            power spectral density. Acoustic data is monitored for abnormal signals in high frequency bands. 
            A normal weld will show nothing of interest here.</p>

                <h2>What is Friction Stir Welding?</h2>
                <p>Friction stir welding (FSW) is a solid-state joining technique that uses a rotating tool to create 
                friction with material, heating it up and joining it. It is primarily used on metal applications 
                which need very high weld strength. FSW is capable of joining aluminium alloys, copper alloys, 
                titanium alloys, mild steel, stainless steel and magnesium alloys. In addition, joining of dissimilar 
                metals, such as aluminium to magnesium alloys, has been achieved by FSW. Application of FSW can be 
                found in modern shipbuilding, trains, automotive, military and aerospace applications.</p>
                A number of potential advantages of FSW over conventional fusion-welding processes have been identified:
                <ul>
                    <li>Good mechanical properties in the as-welded condition.</li>
                    <li>Improved safety due to the absence of toxic fumes or the spatter of molten material.</li>
                    <li>No consumables — A threaded pin made of conventional tool steel, e.g., hardened H13, can weld over 1 km (0.62 mi) of aluminium, and no filler or gas shield is required for aluminium.</li>
                    <li>Easily automated on simple milling machines — lower setup costs and less training.</li>
                    <li>Can operate in all positions (horizontal, vertical, etc.), as there is no weld pool.</li>
                    <li>Generally good weld appearance and minimal thickness under/over-matching, thus reducing the need for expensive machining after welding.</li>
                    <li>Can use thinner materials with same joint strength.</li>
                    <li>Low environmental impact.</li>
                    <li>General performance and cost benefits from switching from fusion to friction.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>However, some disadvantages of the process have been identified:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Exit hole left when tool is withdrawn.</li>
                    <li>Large down forces required with heavy-duty clamping necessary to hold the plates together.</li>
                    <li>Less flexible than manual and arc processes (difficulties with thickness variations and non-linear welds).</li>
                    <li>Often slower traverse rate than some fusion welding techniques, although this may be offset if fewer welding passes are required.</li>
                </ul>
