   - You should see the project files now.
   - Any changes made can be pushed to main unless we feel the need to make branches.
   - Reminder: Get latest version before making any changes.
   - We can try managing code merges on our own or do them together. I don't expect a lot of code conflict??
  
### 3. Running & making changes
   - cd into project folders first.
   - First time / missing libraries can be resolved with `npm install`
   - Run `npm run start` to start application from inside vscode. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
   - Currently, APIs use `npm run dev` to start them up.
