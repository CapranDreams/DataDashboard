        <h1>What is this data?</h1>
        <p>This data dashboard is meant to help operators monitor friction stir welding machinery.</p>
        <p>Friction stir welding is an industrial process used to weld metal by spinning a large pin into 
            the metal surface and generating a lot of friction such that the metals approach melting point 
            and get mixed together. The process is uses extremely large forces that generate a lot of heat 
            and an important aspect to getting good weld quality includes maintaining the temperature and 
            surface finish of the welded metal. The sensors monitored here are indicators of a functioning 
            process.
        </p>
        <p>Thermocouple temperature monitoring works by embedding 8 thermocouples into the anvil below the 
            weld surface. As the machine moves over the part being welded near the thermocouples, the 
            temperature increases. Knowing the rate of motion and the temperature gradient observed in the 
            plot, we can calculate the max temperature of the weld to ensure it does not get too hot or too 
            cold. We can also calculate the total energy input into the weld system. 
        </p>
        <p>Camera frames can be used to observe the amount of flash generated at the weld surface. Flash is 
            defined as hot metal that is extruded out of the surface if the metal gets too hot. If it is 
            observed, the process should be cooled in-situ.
        </p>
        <p>Accelerometer data can be used to observe the acceleration of the machine in the x, y, and z 
            axis. The acceleration data usually shows features of high torque when the machine is running too 
            cold. Similarly, low torque and acceleration can indicate the process is too high. Additionally, 
            acceleration can be used in calculating total energy imparted into the system. Additionally, 
            certain patterns in acceleration combination data can be correlated to certain defects in the 
            welds.
        </p>
        <p>Acoustic data is gathered at 394000 Hz. The data is then plotted in the frequency domain or as a 
            power spectral density. Acoustic data is monitored for abnormal signals in high frequency bands. 
            A normal weld will show nothing of interest here.
